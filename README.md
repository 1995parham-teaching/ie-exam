# Internet Engineering Exams

## Introduction

Questions for Internet Engineering Final/Midterm Exams. Each problem has its specific folder and by customizing `main.tex` you can create your exam.
First exam was a quiz on Beheshti University Fall 2020 when everything was remote.

## Midterms

On midterms, I always ask students to implement a very simple GUI for an API
which is easy, fun and also a good way to measure students knowledge.
