## Build

Repository is structured based on [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/book/latest/index.html)!

## Midterms (Frontend)

On midterms, I always ask students to implement a very simple GUI (based on pure JS, CSS and HTML) for an API
which is easy, fun and also a good way to measure students knowledge.

## Midterms (Backend)

On miterms, I always ask students to implement a very simple Backend server in Go
with a few APIs. They are free to use any library or framework that fits them.
